        <h2>A twist on the Piña Colada; It will cure what ails you.</h2>

        <p>
            Made with dark rum, pineapple juice, orange juice and cream 
            of coconut, the drink was created in the 1970s at the Soggy 
            Dollar Bar in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), where the 
            confluence of warm temperatures and vacation vibes necessitated 
            cold, refreshing libations. And where, with no dock, dollars 
            were bound to get wet as patrons swam ashore.
