        <h2>A twist on the Piña Colada; It will cure what ails you.</h2>

        <p>
            Made with dark rum, pineapple juice, orange juice and cream 
            of coconut, the drink was created in the 1970s at the <br>Soggy 
            Dollar Bar in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), where the
            confluence of warm temperatures and vacation vibes <br>necessitated 
            cold, refreshing libations. And where, with no dock, dollars 
            were bound to get wet as patrons swam ashore.
