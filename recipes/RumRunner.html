        <h2>A tropical cocktail with rum, banana liqueur and grenadine</h2>

        <p>
            This recipe is a bit less saccharine and more sophisticated than many others, since it 
            eschews the spiced and coconut-flavored <br>rums you’ll sometimes see and opts for lime juice 
            over orange. But really, you should feel free to tweak this drink in any way <br>you like, 
            including playing with ingredients and proportions. There’s no real wrong way to make a 
            Rum Runner, as long as <br>you come up with something you enjoy drinking.
        </p>
