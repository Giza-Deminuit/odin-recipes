        <h1>Rum Runner</h1>
        <img src="./images/rum_runner.jpg">
        <h2>A tropical cocktail with rum, banana liqueur and grenadine</h2>

        <p>
            This recipe is a bit less saccharine and more sophisticated than many others, since it 
            eschews the spiced and coconut-flavored rums you’ll sometimes see and opts for lime juice 
            over orange. But really, you should feel free to tweak this drink in any way you like, 
            including playing with ingredients and proportions. There’s no real wrong way to make a 
            Rum Runner, as long as you come up with something you enjoy drinking.
